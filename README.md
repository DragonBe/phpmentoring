# PHPMentoring exercises

These are exercises used during the PHPMentorships I had with people, sharing them to the community.

## Mentorships

This is the list of mentorships I had, providing for each mentorship a separate branch. All mentorships will be combined into master branch to keep records of all activity.

### Scalability

I had a mentorship with hbeague on scalability and bringing PHP coding to the next level. You will find all exercises and documentation in branch scalability as in this master repository.

## Getting involved

Go to [PHPMentoring](http://phpmentoring.org) and sign yourself up as padawan (who seeks mentorship) or as mentor (who gives mentorship). There's no money involved here and all is done out of free will and passion. If you're seeking ways to make money training people, this is not the spot.
